  .then(batteryPercent => {
    if (batteryPercent != -1) {
      console.log(`Battery charge is ${batteryPercent}%.`)
    } else {
      console.log(`Battery charge can't be determined. Possibly running on a device with no battery.`)
    }
  }).catch(err => {
    console.log(`error: ${err}.`);
  });

// Possible Returns:
//=> Battery charge can't be determined. Possibly running on a device with no battery.
//=> Battery charge is 100%.

macOsBattery.getBatteryChargeState()
    .then(batteryState => {
      console.log(`Battery charge state is '${batteryState}'.`)
    }).catch(err => {
  console.log(`error: ${err}.`);
});

// Possible Returns:
//=> Battery charge state is 'charged'.
//=> Battery charge state is 'discharging'.
